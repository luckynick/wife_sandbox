# Creative Sandbox

Welcome! This is your personal playground to create beautiful web pages with Claude's help.

## What This Is

This is a website builder where you can ask Claude to create pages for you. Each time you start a new chat and create something new, it gets its own special place on the website - nothing gets lost!

## How It Works

1. **Ask Claude to create a page** - Just describe what you want! For example:
   - "Create a page about my favorite recipes"
   - "Make a photo gallery page for our vacation"
   - "Build a page with inspirational quotes"

2. **Each creation gets its own address** - When you create something, it appears at its own web address (like `/my-recipes` or `/vacation-photos`)

3. **Nothing disappears** - Even if you start a new chat and create new things, your old creations stay available

4. **The home page shows everything** - Visit the main page to see links to all your creations

## What to Say to Claude

When you want to create a new page, just say things like:

- "Create a new page called [name] that shows [what you want]"
- "Make me a pretty page with [description]"
- "I want a page about [topic]"

Claude will:
1. Create the page for you
2. Make it look nice with colors and styling
3. Put it on the website so you can see it

## Have Fun!

This is your creative space - experiment, play, and create whatever you like!
